# CC_Binds
Program for creating binds on TruckersMP | ETS2/ATS

---

This program was created to simplify the task of **Convoy Control** members during large events in **Euro Truck Simulator 2** and **American Truck Simulator** games on the **TruckersMP** project.

The program is written in **AutoHotKey** language and sends prepared messages to the chat by simulating button presses.
The program can either send one message with a single press, or can infinitely send messages in 10-second intervals by pressing another key of your choice.

Once you have assigned a certain button, it will be written to the **ccbinds.ini** file, which is located in your **Documents** directory.
